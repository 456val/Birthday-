  <h3>35 Beautiful Things About You ❤️</h3>
  <p>
    At 35, you shine with a light that words can barely hold.<br>
    You’ve mastered the art of peace in a noisy world,<br>
    and your calm feels like a quiet sunrise after a storm.<br><br>

    You carry strength not to show off — but to protect,<br>
    and love, not for reward — but because it’s who you are.<br>
    Your laughter is gentle, your smile, a reason for joy.<br><br>

    You give without keeping count.<br>
    You forgive without holding back.<br>
    You dream, and you chase those dreams with grace.<br><br>

    You’re wiser, softer, stronger — all at once.<br>
    You make patience look beautiful.<br>
    You lead with silence that speaks volumes.<br><br>

    You turn ordinary days into meaning.<br>
    You see beauty where others see routine.<br>
    You’ve built your life on courage and calm.<br><br>

    You make love look like truth.<br>
    You carry people in your prayers, even when they don’t know.<br>
    You’ve learned to let go and grow — again and again.<br><br>

    You are 35 shades of greatness, Williams.<br>
    35 reasons to be proud.<br>
    35 chapters of a story still unfolding beautifully.<br><br>

    And if I could, I’d write 35 more lines —<br>
    just to say how deeply you are loved.<br><br>

    Happy Birthday, my dearest.<br>
    May this year open doors, heal hearts, and bring all your desires true. ❤️
